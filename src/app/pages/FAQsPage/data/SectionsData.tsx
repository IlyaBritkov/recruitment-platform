		title: 'How are interviews conducted at Exadel?',
		text: `Our hiring process includes three interviews: a recruiter interview, 
      an internal technical interview, and typically an interview with a client. 
      In the recruiter interview we evaluate soft skills and English language level. 
      Most recruiter interviews last about 30-40 minutes. In the internal technical 
      interivew, an expert will evaluate skills and general knowledge of a particular 
      tech stack. Whenever possible, we try to involve developers from the team the 
      applicant is applying for, so they can get as much information as possible 
      about the future project. Internal technical interviews usually last about 
      60-90 minutes. The final stage of the interview process is the client interivew. 
      This interview is conducted directly by a company client to evaluate whether or 
      not the candidate is a good match for their project. This is also a good chance 
      for candidates to ask any additional questions they may have. In most cases the 
      Client interview takes about 40-60 minutes.`,

		title: 'How can I progress in my career at Exadel?',
		text: `Our employees can apply for higher positions whenever they feel they're ready to 
      be evaluated. Employees let their HR manager know they would like to apply for a new 
      position, and they'll start with the promotion process. There are three main stages: 
      1. An English interview with an English teacher who will evaluate the employee's 
      general language skill level. 2. A soft skills interview with an HR manager to evalue 
      the employees' soft skills, according the requirements of the desired position. This 
      evaluation also takes into account performance feedback that the employee received 
      during the course of their regular work. 3. A technical interview with an expert to 
      evaluate how well the employee's technical skills match the position they are applying 
      for. The technical interviewer will generally give feedback on areas where the 
      employee can improve their skills. We do our best to avoid subjectivity by having 
      several different experts conduct the technical interview. The entire promotion 
      assessment process takes about two weeks.`,
